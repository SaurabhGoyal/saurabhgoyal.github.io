I am a **web developer**, specifically a backend developer primarily using Django framework. Have hands on on everything that's a part of **product delivery** ranging from planning and design to development and deployment.

Previously I was involved in **competitive programming** for some time, got good at it and developed a keen interest in data structures and algorithms eventually leading to problem solving.

Developed some **games** in college - web based [TicTacToe](http://unbeatablettt.appspot.com/) and windows phone based [MineSweeper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/store/p/minesweeper/9nblggh08wmv)

When it comes to design and implementation, I have one philosophy-
> Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. **- Abraham Lincoln**
