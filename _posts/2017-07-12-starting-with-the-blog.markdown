Today, I am starting with my technical blog. The posts will be a weekly thing (*hopefully*) where I'll pour out all my week's knowledge so that both mine and others' time is put to full use.

My posts will vary from a particular web development framework to coding practices to project management and even feature delivery. I am no expert, but will get there.

I am starting this with following quote in mind-
